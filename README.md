# Benmark-Datasets-for-Machine-Learning-Application-in-Power-Grids
We provide a collection of power grid datasets either realistic and simulated and the machine learning algorithms applied to the datasets  as benchmarks, aiming at motivating more advanced and robust algorithms for the future realistic power grids.
